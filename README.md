# Data-Cleaning-and-Preprocessing

I have used Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset, on which I have tried to used multiple functions to cleaned the dataset. 
I worked on Google Collab for this project and these are the summarized points

  1. Data types: Ensured age is int
  2. Missing values: No nulls were found.
  3. Duplicates: Any duplicate rows were removed.
  4. Text standardization: gender values are now in lowercase (male, female).
  5. Date formatting: There were no date column.
  6. Column names: Cleaned and converted to lowercase with underscores (e.g., annual_income_k_).
